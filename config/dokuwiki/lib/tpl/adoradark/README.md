## Adora Dark Dokuwiki Template
`git clone git://github.com/notconscious/dokuwiki-template-adoradark.git`

A dark theme with orange and yellow trim originally based on the default template for the October 13 2012 release of Dokuwiki, codenamed "Adora Belle." The original was created by [Clarence Lee](http://github.com/MrClow), and it has an interesting backstory, which you can read [here](http://blog.selfthinker.org/2012/10/20/the-story-behind-dokuwikis-new-template/). I really love the new design, so I changed the colors to my liking. You can change the colors and page widths to suit your needs by editing **style.local.ini**. See this template's about page on [Dokuwiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org/template:adoradark) for more info.

I tend to prefer dark themes for most things because they don't hurt my eyes so much. I've noticed only a few dark themes for Dokuwiki over the past few years, so I felt like contributing one to the community. Enjoy...
